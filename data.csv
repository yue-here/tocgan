b'Design Rules of Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks with High Chemical and Thermal Stabilities',,"b'Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), self-assembled from strategically pre-designed molecular tectons with complementary hydrogen-bonding patterns, are rapidly evolving into a novel and important class of porous materials. In addition to their common features shared with other functionalized porous materials constructed from modular building blocks, the intrinsically flexible and reversible H-bonding connections endow HOFs with straightforward purification procedures, high crystallinity, solution processability, and recyclability. These unique advantages of HOFs have attracted considerable attention across a broad range of fields, including gas adsorption and separation, catalysis, chemical sensing, and electrical and optical materials. However, the relatively weak H-bonding interactions within HOFs can potentially limit their stability and potential use in further applications. To that end, this Perspective highlights recent advances in the development of chemically and thermally robust HOF materials and systematically discusses relevant design rules and synthesis strategies to access highly stable HOFs.'"

b'Defect-Regulated Frustrated-Lewis-Pair Behavior of Boron Nitride in Ambient Pressure Hydrogen Activation',/cms/10.1021/jacs.2c00343/asset/images/medium/ja2c00343_0005.gif,"b'The construction of heterogeneous frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) with performance comparable to or surpassing the homogeneous counterparts in H2 activation is a long-standing challenge. Herein, sterically hindered Lewis acid (\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d center) and Lewis base (\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d center) sites were anchored within the rigid lattice of highly crystalline hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) scaffolds. The active sites were created via precision defect regulation during the molten-salt-involved (NaNH2 and NaBH4) h-BN construction procedure. The as-afforded h-BN scaffolds achieved highly efficient H2/D2 activation and dissociation under ambient pressure via FLP-like behavior, and attractive catalytic efficiency in hydrogenation reactions surpassing the current heterogeneous analogues.'"

b'Site Isolation in Metal\xe2\x80\x93Organic Layers Enhances Photoredox Gold Catalysis',/cms/10.1021/jacs.2c03062/asset/images/medium/ja2c03062_0006.gif,"b'Herein, we report the synthesis of a metal\xe2\x80\x93organic layer, Hf\xe2\x80\x93Ru\xe2\x80\x93Au, containing Ru(bipyridine)32+-type photosensitizers and (phosphine)-AuCl catalysts for photoredox Au-catalyzed cross-coupling of allenoates, alkenes, or alkynes with aryldiazonium salts to afford furanone, tetrahydrofuran, or aryl alkyne derivatives, respectively. Site isolation of (phosphine)-AuCl complexes in Hf\xe2\x80\x93Ru\xe2\x80\x93Au prevents Au catalyst deactivation via ligand redistribution, Au(I) disproportionation, and aryl-phosphine reductive elimination, while the proximity between the Ru photosensitizers and Au catalysts enhances catalytic efficiency, with 14\xe2\x80\x93200 times higher activity over those of the homogeneous controls in the cross-coupling reactions.'"

b'DNA-Templated Reactions with High Catalytic Efficiency Achieved by a Loss-of-Affinity Principle',/cms/10.1021/jacs.2c03188/asset/images/medium/ja2c03188_0005.gif,"b'Nucleic-acid-templated chemical reactions are currently explored for applications in DNA-encoded drug discovery, nucleic acid diagnostics, and theranostics. Of particular interest are reactions enabling the template to gain catalytic activity, so that enzymatic amplification of low copy targets would no longer be necessary. Herein, we introduce a new reaction design relying on the template-controlled cleavage of PNA-spermine conjugates. With turnover frequencies in the range of 3\xe2\x80\x9310 min\xe2\x80\x931 and a kcat/KM = 1.3 \xc3\x97 106 M\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931, the loss of affinity upon reaction provides a catalytic efficiency equal to most enzymatic conversions and superior to nucleic-acid-templated reactions reported to date.'"

The ternary catalytic system enables the coupling of \xce\xb2-ketocarbonyls and olefins with good yields and high enantioselectivities. Mechanism studies disclosed a cooperative radical addition process with a chiral \xce\xb1-imino radical and Co(II)-metalloradical wherein the chiral primary aminocatalyst and the cobaloxime catalyst work in concert to control the stereoinduction.'"
